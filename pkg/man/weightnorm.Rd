\title{Normalize by sample weight}
\usage{
weightnorm(object, weight = "weight", lg = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an \code{ExpressionSet}}

\item{weight}{a string naming the pheno data column with the
weight or a numeric vector with one weight value per sample.}

\item{lg}{is the assay data already on the log-scale or not. If
lg, the weight value is also log-transformed and subtraction is
used instead of division.}
}
\value{
the normalized expression set
}
\description{
Normalize samples by their weight (as in grams fresh weight)
}
\details{
Normalize each sample by dividing by the loaded sample weight. The
weight argument is takes from the pheno data (or given as numerical
vector with one value per sample). Missing values are not
tolerated.

\examples{
data(mix)
w <- runif(ncol(mix),1, 1.3)
weightnorm(mix, w)
